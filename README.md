Hey! This is my 4th mini project that I've built from a list of projects that I plan to build just to refine my skills and learn a bit more about interacting with the DOM.

With this project I used Tailwind CSS as using ordinary css was taking too much time and gave me less time to work on the javascript portion which is primarily why I'm building these.

So far this has definitely been the easiest project but I'm still learning small things along the way and that's all that really matters.
